# bartti

This model based on BART which using Transformer structure and with a detaily designed training task.
Our bartti is one of the derives of BART model that aiming applied in Traffic Prediction.

# Paper Profile
Vehicle trajectory prediction preforms an essential basement of several related work. Such as trajectory compensation, traffic condition judgement, future path generation as well as vehciles simulation. Actually, the well-learned driving strategy is one of the keys to realize these tasks. This paper aims to build a pre-training task, based on the Transformer structure, to learn the performance of vehicles in different traffic flow states, and then connect to the above-mentioned downstream tasks. Transformer is good at learning the interaction between vehicles and predicting overall features.  Humm.. It would be even better if it could incorporate driving information.

## Following work
- func trans_to_array
- 挖空
- 有embed要改一下
- 大数据集制作，需要注意归一化一下车辆出现的位置
- main
